Let's get started with creating a new implementation to query the user database table using R2DBC for Reactive Java.

To confirm, we'll create the following:

1. A repository interface (`UserRepository.java`)
2. A service class (`UserService.java`)
3. A controller class (`UserController.java`)

We'll use the standard package structure: `com.example.myapp.repository`, `com.example.myapp.service`, and `com.example.myapp.controller`.

Before we begin, I just want to confirm that you're using Spring Boot with R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity) for database interactions. Is that correct?
